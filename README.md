# Fake-News-Detection-on-Social-Media-Using-Graph-Neural-Networks
This project implements a **Fake News Detection system** using **Graph Neural Networks (GCNs)** to analyze relationships and content patterns in news data. It provides a simple **Flask-based web interface** where users can input news text and get real-time predictions as *Fake* or *Real*.
